INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESLA VIN CHECKER

This is a relatively simple install process and should take you no more than 10 minutes. You will need a Raspberry Pi 3 or newer, running Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop.

STEP 1: If you haven’t already, go to https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/ and download “Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop”. The reason you need the desktop version is because Tesla is very good at detecting bots, and we need to run this in a viewable browser (see FAQ for detailed explanation). Flash this to your SD card and setup as necessary.

STEP 2: Once you are up and running, install the necessary packages by opening a terminal window and entering the following commands:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver python3-pip
	sudo pip install selenium

STEP 3: Open “Thonny Python IDE” and paste the contents of “teslavinchecker.py”. You will need to enter in the following information where indicated in the code:

	Reservation Number
	Tesla account username and password
	VIN prefix (In 2022 it is LRW, however this may change. Check TMC or VedaPrime’s Discord for updated information)

STEP 4: Save the file, name it whatever you like and press “Run current script” (green play icon, top left corner). The following will happen:

	A blank chrome window opens
	The script will login to your Tesla account, check for a VIN and logout again. If there is no VIN, it will continue to check every 60 minutes. If a VIN is found, it will close.
	
NOTES: 

	Do NOT close the chrome browser window, otherwise you will need to stop the script and run it again.
	The chrome window will always remain open.
	You can monitor progress by watching the comments in the shell, under the code in Thonny Python IDE. I recommend leaving this open as it will notify you when a VIN has been found.

Enjoy!
